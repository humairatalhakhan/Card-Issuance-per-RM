# 3️⃣ Approach (Data Analysis Life Cycle)

### Data Collection
- Gathered monthly Excel data from onboarding records for corporates.

### Data Preparation
- Cleaned and formatted data using **Excel Tables**.
- Added formulas for % achievement:
  ```excel
  =IFERROR((C5/B5)*100, 0)

Created named ranges for regions (DXB, SHJ, AUH).

Used Pivot Tables to aggregate card issuance per RM and region.

### Data Analysis

Calculated total cards issued and % achieved by RM.

Compared results against the 750-card target per RM.

Identified high and low performers.

### Data Visualization

Created three main charts in Excel:
1️⃣ Donut Chart – Displays Total Cards Issued vs Target (Overall Achievement % in center).
2️⃣ Clustered Column + Line Chart – Shows region-wise comparison (Actual vs Target + Achievement %).
3️⃣ Bar Chart – RM-level breakdown of Card Issuance (Top vs Bottom performers).

### Insights

Highlighted which RMs exceeded 90% achievement.

Identified underperforming regions (<75% achievement).

Helped management focus coaching efforts where needed.
