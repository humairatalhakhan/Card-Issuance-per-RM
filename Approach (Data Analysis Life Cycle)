## 🧭 Approach (Data Analysis Life Cycle)

### 1. Business Understanding
This project analyzes the **Cards Issuance Performance** of **Relationship Managers (RMs)** across multiple branches (DXB, SHJ, AUH).  
The goal is to evaluate **Q2 cards issuance** against the **allocated quarterly budget**, helping management assess RM productivity and branch efficiency.

**Key Objectives:**
- Measure actual card issuance vs. budget for each branch and RM.  
- Identify high-performing RMs and underperforming areas.  
- Support decision-making for resource allocation and performance-based incentives.

### 2. Data Understanding
The dataset consolidates information from **branch submissions**, **operations updates**, and **RM performance trackers**.  
Each record represents the number of cards issued to corporates by individual RMs during Q2.

**Data Attributes:**
- **Branch** – AUH, DXB, SHJ  
- **RM Name** – Responsible Relationship Manager  
- **Q2 Budget** – Target number of cards to be issued  
- **Q2 Total** – Actual number of cards issued  
- **% Achieved** – (Actual / Budget) × 100  

**Example Summary Table:**
| Branch | Q2 Total | Q2 Budget | % Achieved |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| AUH | 4,200 | 4,500 | 187% |
| DXB | 4,170 | 4,500 | 185% |
| SHJ | 4,475 | 4,500 | 199% |
| **Grand Total** | **12,845** | **13,500** | **571%** |

### 3. Data Preparation
The data collected from multiple branches was standardized and prepared for analysis.

**Key Preparation Steps:**
- Validated and cleaned RM-wise data received from branch coordinators.  
- Ensured acknowledgment sheets were attached for each corporate.  
- Arranged KYC pages at the top of each file for consistency.  
- Combined all branch data into a consolidated Excel sheet.  
- Created calculated columns for **% Achievement** and **Variance** (Actual – Budget).

### 4. Data Modeling & Analysis
The cleaned dataset was analyzed using **Excel** and **Power BI** to evaluate RM and branch performance.

**Analytical Techniques Used:**
- **Pivot Tables** for RM-level summaries and branch comparisons.  
- **Calculated Measures:**  
  - `% Achieved = (Actual ÷ Budget) × 100`  
  - `Variance = Actual – Budget`  
- Conditional formatting to highlight top/bottom performers.  
- Trend and comparison charts (Budget vs Actual).

**Dashboard Highlights:**
- Branch-level KPIs for total cards issued vs budget.  
- RM-wise performance and achievement percentages.  
- Comparative visuals across DXB, SHJ, and AUH branches.  
- Aggregated totals and variance indicators for Q2.
